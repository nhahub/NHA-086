**Land Type Classification Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Deep Neural Networks:**

Accurate land-use and land-cover (LULC) classification is a critical component of modern environmental monitoring and spatial planning. 
With the growing availability of high-resolution Earth observation data, advanced machine learning techniques such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) 
provide new opportunities to automate and enhance the precision of land-type classification. This project focuses on developing a 
DNN model that classifies various land types—including agriculture, water, urban areas, deserts, roads, and vegetation
—using multispectral imagery from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 mission. 
The report outlines the technical approach for dataset preparation, model design, training, and evaluation,
as well as the expected outcomes for supporting sustainable resource management, urban planning, and climate research.
